# [CloakingOcean.com](https://cloakingocean.com/ "Cloaking Ocean Website")
CloakingOcean.com is a personal, custom coded portfolio I made for myself, Shawn Whitaker!
It showcases many different aspects of my life.

## Java
I've known Java and the Bukkit API since 2012! I mainly use Java to create Minecraft server
mods!

## Unity
First introduced to me during my initial Spy Hop session, Unity has become a game engine favorite
of mine! It's incredible how much it offers while still having a completely free version!

## Web
Step by step, I learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to improve on my previous website designs!

## Gaming
Being my favorite pastime, gaming is something I started from a very young age. I've continued
to increase my skills and understanding in this aspect as well!

## Music
With a majority of my life being filled with music, I've learned how to perform music myself by playing the piano!

### Scripts
Once you have installed all of the packages using npm install, use npm start. This will first package all of the sass files and then start the server.

### Development
I initially created this webpage as an introduction to Bootstrap using mainly HTML and CSS with a small portion of
JavaScript. This project, however, converts the webpage into a quick and responsive React app! This was my first 
major project with React and I look forward to improving my website's content and functionality as I continue to learn!
