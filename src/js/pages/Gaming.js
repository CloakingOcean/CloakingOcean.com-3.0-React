                        <h2>Gaming Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since the beginning of my childhood, I've held a controller in my hands! My older brother and sister were avid gamers before me, and
                            I followed in their footsteps. I mainly played on Nintendo systems and eventually Xbox 360 games when I was younger. These days,
                            I do most of my gaming on the computer with occasional breaks on other systems.

                        <h2>Early Nintendo</h2>
                        <p>
                            My brother has a large arrangement of classic Nintendo consoles such as the NES <i>(Nintendo Entertainment System)</i>,
                            SNES <i>(Super Nintendo Entertainment System)</i>, Nintendo 64, and Gamecube! My favorite game for the NES has to be{' '}
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contra</a>! It's a side scroller shooter
                            that also has a small trick you can use to gain 30 lives compared to the 3 lives you start out with! You face an army
                            of opponents while dying if shot only once!
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            I'd say my favorite game from the SNES system is{' '}
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario World</a>! The adventurous theme
                            of this game makes any new player excited to explore! A significant part of the game I personally enjoy is the implementation
                            of Yoshies. Mario can ride on their back, and different colored Yoshies have different unique abilities! For example, the red
                            Yoshi spits fire when it spits something out while the blue Yoshi flies into the air when it has something in its mouth!
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            I'm unsure if I have a specific favorite when it comes to Nintendo 64 games. However, my top favorites are{' '}
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banjo Kazooie</a>,{' '}
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario 64</a>,
                            and{' '}<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauntlet_Legends#Ports" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gauntlet Legends</a>!
                            Banjo Kazooie has a fantastic aesthetic along with various different abilities and
                            guns the duo can use! The storyline is very compelling as well! Super Mario 64 was a top-rated game when it came out
                            due to its effective implementation of 3D platforming! Finally, Gauntlet Legends is a game about restoring balance after
                            a massive outbreak of a dangerous character! You must explore all of the different realms and regain power in each to
                            be able to fight the final boss! It's a 4-player game with a ton of fun mechanics!
                        </p>

                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi%27s_Mansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luigi's Mansion</a>, and{' '}
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikmin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pikmin</a> are my top 3 favorite GameCube games! The Legend of Zelda: The Wind
                            Waker has an amazing cartoonish art style! It's a massive shift from the previous Legend of Zelda games! One primary game mechanic
                            of this game is sailing in a boat to get across the vast ocean and reach islands sprinkled throughout the entire map! Although that
                            may sound tedious, this game gives you the ability to change the direction of the wind! Thus, you can sail anywhere you want with ease!
                            This game also has a ton of puzzles and story! I'd highly recommend playing this game if possible! Luigi's Mansion is a great twist
                            of the classic "Mario saves the day" theme. In this story, Luigi is the one saving Mario! With the help of a genius professor, you are
                            equipped with ghost capturing machines to rid a newly created mansion of all its ghosts! There are also sequels of this game as well
                            that I would highly recommend! And finally, Pikmin is a game all about returning home. When the main character, Olimar, crash lands
                            on a distant planet and all hope seems lost, he discovers small creatures he names Pikmin who eventually help him retrieve his ship parts
                            and return home! It's exciting to build up an army and trounce your foes when making use of each pikmin's abilities!

                        <h2>Xbox 360</h2>
                        <p>
                            With the generally more mature games available on the Xbox 360, it was a hard sell for my father. However, he was eventualy convinced,
                            and my first games consisted of{' '}<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Pi%C3%B1ata_(video_game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viva Piñata</a>{' '}
                            and{' '}<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo-Kazooie:_Nuts_%26_Bolts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts</a>! Viva Piñata
                            personally was a let down because its gameplay was nothing like the TV show! It felt more like someone made a game and made it look
                            like Viva Piñata. For Banjo Kazooie Nuts & Bolts, however, I found I enjoyed it much more than the majority. Even though it was a
                            significant change in the franchise, it introduced gameplay that was still exciting and entertaining! The whole point of the game is to
                            create vehicles and obtain upgrades to make the best machine for whatever challenge you're facing! It's a very creative game,
                            and I enjoyed making my own design of carts, boats, and planes!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Eventually, a friend introduced me to the game{' '}<a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Xbox_360_Edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft</a>!
                            Instantly, I was hooked! Minecraft is a game about survival and creativity. Most of the world consists of square blocks which can be
                            harvested and collected. It's a very open-ended game because there's no real "end" to the game. Even if you beat the final boss named
                            the "Ender Dragon", you just continue onwards! The player vs. player component was also very thrilling! On some days, my friends and I
                            would split up and see who could muster up the most resources and finish off the others! Back in this time, there was no creative mode
                            which allowed people to have infinite building blocks! However, there was a duplication glitch that allowed players to do some crazy things!
                            My friend later showed me the{' '}<a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC version of Minecraft</a>,
                            and I was amazed at all the different creatures and creative mode options! This is what eventually led me to PC gaming!

                        <h2>PC Gaming</h2>
                        <p>
                            My first gaming computer, a Mac Book Pro, was sold to me by a friend at a very generous price! It was the first time I'd used a Mac computer
                            before! It took quite a long time to get used to. The first program I installed was Minecraft! My friend and I
                            actually bought each other Minecraft! I was so excited to play around with the in-game commands, additional mobs, and creative mode! Shortly
                            after, my friend and I joined public servers and learned more about the plugins in use in most servers! Like I mentioned on the Java page, this
                            is what led my programming desire to learn more about plugins and create my own! Minecraft has always been one of my favorite games. Although,
                            recently it's become more of creative space to develop plugins than an actual game for me.
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">League of Legends</a> was another major game my friends and I played! League
                            is a MOBA <i>(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena)</i> which consists of 2 teams with 5 people each! Each side has a nexus which if destroyed
                            wins the game for the other team!
        
                            Additionally, there are many different mechanics to learn and master. First of all is the deep character pool.
                            Also, you gain money to buy items that specifically boost your champion. For me, the learning curve seemed quite steep, and
                            I didn't play very seriously. But eventually, after enough time playing and practice, I really enjoyed playing it and improving my skills as well!
                        </p>
        
                        <p>
                            Steam was always a program I heard about, but I knew nothing of at this point. A relative showed me the ropes and all the various games
                            he enjoyed playing. My personal favorites over the years have been{' '}<a href="https://gmod.facepunch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garry's Mod</a>,{' '}
                            <a href="https://www.superwinthegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Win the Game</a>,
                            and{' '}<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_Souls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Titan Souls</a>! Garry's Mod, similarly to Minecraft, had a very
                            creative aspect to it! My favorite official modes
                            were{' '}<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_in_Terrorist_Town" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trouble in Terrorist Town</a> and{' '}
                            <a href="https://gmod.fandom.com/wiki/Prop_Hunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prop Hunt</a>! Super Win the Game has fantastic retro style and mechanics!
                            It was very nostalgic for me, and I'm glad that, with modern technology, annoying bugs are much less frequent. It was a nice jump back into time when
                            things felt much more peaceful as a kid. And finally, Titan Souls is a fabulous game! Your character is tiny compared to the enormous beasts
                            and monsters you face! This game requires a bit of skill to dodge and land your shots accurately. But the payoff feels terrific! Taking down something
                            10 times your size with a single arrow shot!
